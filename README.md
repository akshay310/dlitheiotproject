Project On IoT Enabled Smart Cradle as part of Internship in DLithe

Problem Statement

As we are very well familiar with the hurdles faced by Parents to nurture their infant and especially in case if both the Parents are working. To give 24 hours of time in such cases is next to impossible. Thus, we need to develop something unique that can help Parents to have a continuous surveillance/watch on the Baby/Infant and can notify about the same. 

Solution

Thus, we have come up with an idea to design a Smart Cradle System using IOT which will help the Parents to monitor their child even if they are away from home & detect every activity of the Baby from any distant corner of the world. 

Methodology

We have included sound sensors to detect crying and happiness of the baby, moisture detection in case of bed wetting or diaper change, a temperature and humidity sensor (DHT11) for checking the room temperature and a 3 axis gyroscope to prevent the baby from falling if a major inclination of the cradle is detected.
As soon as the baby starts crying, the cradle swings for some seconds and then stops once the baby stops crying and "BABY IS SAD" is displayed. If bed wetting is detected, "BABY NEEDS A DIAPER CHECK" is shown. If there is an maximum inclination of the cradle of more than 30 degrees, then "BABY NEEDS TO BE CHECKED UPON" is displayed.
